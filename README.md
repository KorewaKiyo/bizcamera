### BizCamera 
## A business card sized camera

# Why?
I thought it was a cool and silly enough idea to be unique, and I couldn't find anyone else doing it. So I took it on myself to make it happen.

# How?
Initially I wanted to go with something STM32, as the camera module wants 1.8V, and there were some good STM32 MCUs with 1.8v, but it seemed like none of them were fast enough or had enough RAM to grab frames from the sensor. 
So I'm using the RP2350 and OV5640

# What's the output like?
